Update 2022 - Module got full overhaul in February for compatibility with FreeBPX 16 and set new a miniumum FreePBX version of 15. Earlier versions of FreePBX will be limited to module ver. 0.0.4 only. May Fix resolved an issue where the splice would fail if there are no outbound routes with trunks.
